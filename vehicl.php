				<p class="T">Motor vehicle insurance covers both the driver and the vehicle. Every motor vehicle used in traffic must be insured with statutory motor liability insurance that covers any personal injuries and vehicle damage of any innocent party. You should also take out comprehensive motor vehicle insurance which covers, among other things, dents when parking, engine problems, and chipped windscreens caused by a small stone. You can tailor the coverage to meet your vehicle's needs. Learn more about our insurance policies, calculate the price and buy easily below. </p>

			   <p >Auto accidents can happen, even to the best of us. An auto insurance policy can help cover repairs to your vehicle and medical costs in the event of an accident. Think of it as your firewall against economic disaster should you be found at fault for property damage or injuries to other people.</p>

			<p class="Tanu">What are the types of car insurance coverages?</p>
			
			<p class="Tanu1">1. Bodily Injury liability provides protection if you injure or kill someone while operating your car. It also provides for a legal defense if another party in the accident files a lawsuit against you.In the event of a serious accident, you want enough insurance to cover a judgment against you in a lawsuit, without jeopardizing your personal assets. Bodily Injury liability covers injury to people, not your vehicle. Therefore, it's a good idea to have the same level of coverage for all of your cars.</p>
			
			<p class="Tanu2">2. Property Damage liability protects you if your car damages someone else's property. It also provides you with legal defense if another party files a lawsuit against you. It is a good idea to purchase enough of this insurance to cover the amount of damage your car might do to another vehicle or object. </p>
			 
			<p class="Tanu3">3. Uninsured Motorist coverage pays for your injuries caused by an uninsured driver or, in some states, a hit-and-run driver. In some states, there is also Uninsured Motorist coverage for damage to your vehicle.Given the large number of uninsured motorists, this is very important coverage to have, even in states with no-fault insurance</p>
